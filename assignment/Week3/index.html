    <h3>Section 1: School</h3>
        <p>I Graduated from Harlem High School in 2011. Then I continued to go to Rock Valley College while I was working full-time. It took me 5 years to complete my associates degree in Web Design and Programming. I graduated from Rock Valley in 2017. I took 1 semester off, then I started at University of North Dakota in the spring session of 2018! While at UND I graduated in December 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Communication. Then I decided that I wanted to get back into web design and so in April 2020, i applied for my dream college.... COLUMBIA COLLEGE CHICAGO! And i guess now that im making an assignment for it, I got in. I will be graduating in May of 2022. </p>
    <h3>Section 2: Life</h3>
        <p>My name is Kasey Bartelt. I will be telling you all about my life. I was born on March 7th, to loving parents from North Dakota. While they were born and raised in North Dakota, I was born and raised in Illinois. WE spent a lot of time up in North Dakota with family though. So fast foward 3 years when I meet the love of my life in my preschool class. Now at this point and time i did not know he was the love of my life but there he was. Now after high school is when we started dating and have been together every since. I do have a rare benign tumor on the pituitary gland. It is something that I found out at 21 that I had! What a great 21st birthday right! NOT! My husband and I got married in February of 2018! We have been loving life every since.   </p>
    <h3>Section 3: Work</h3>
        <p>While right now I am focusing on school. I have had many of jobs teaching little children. My favorite job would probably be teaching my favorite little toddlers. When they get something new like walking, it just brought a light to my life. After that some of my favorite jobs are design pamphlets and redoing the website for a door and window company based out of Rockford. or designing my friends photography website along with creating multiple other websites!  </p>
